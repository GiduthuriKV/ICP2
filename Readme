In CODE 1, I first defined a function called "fullname" that takes in two arguments (firstname and lastname). Then the program prompts the user to enter their first name and last name using the "input" function, which assigns the user's input to the variables "firstname" and "lastname". Now the program calls the "fullname" function and passes in "first_name" and "last_name" as arguments, and then prints the returned value, the full name. Finally, the program calls the "string_alternative" function and passes in "full_name" as an argument and prints the returned value, every other character of the full name.

In CODE 2, This program opens the "input.txt" file in read mode using the open() function and the with statement. Then it reads all the contents of the file and assigns it to the variable "lines". Then it opens the "output.txt" file in write mode and uses a for loop to iterate over each line in the "lines" variable. For each line, it uses the split() function to split the line into words, and assigns the number of words in the line to the variable "wordcount". Then it uses the write() function to write the value of "wordcount" and the line to the output file, and also prints out the value of "wordcount" and the line. This process is repeated for each line in the input file. The output file will contain wordcount and each line in the input file.

In CODE 3, The input is then converted to a list of floats using a list comprehension. uses a for loop to iterate over the list of customer heights in inches and for each height, it multiplies it by 2.54 to convert it to centimeters and appends the result to the list "height_cms". program uses list comprehension to convert the heights from inches to centimeters and assigns the result to the variable "height_cms". Finally, the program prints the list of customer heights in centimeters.
